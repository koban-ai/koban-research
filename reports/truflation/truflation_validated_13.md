## Vulnerability in `TrufVesting.sol` Contract: Incorrect Use of `memory` Instead of `storage` Leading to State Inconsistency

### **Description**

In the `TrufVesting.sol` contract, the `cancelVesting` function incorrectly uses the `memory` keyword instead of `storage` when handling the `UserVesting` struct. This mistake results in modifications to the `userVesting` not being persisted to the contract's state, leading to incorrect accounting of vesting amounts. Specifically, changes to `userVesting.claimed` and `userVesting.locked` are lost, causing discrepancies in users' vesting balances and potentially allowing users to claim more tokens than they are entitled to.

### **Affected Function**

```solidity
function cancelVesting(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address user, bool giveUnclaimed)
    external
    onlyOwner
{
    UserVesting memory userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user];

    // ... (other code)

    if (giveUnclaimed && claimableAmount != 0) {
        trufToken.safeTransfer(user, claimableAmount);

        userVesting.claimed += claimableAmount; // Modification not saved
        category.totalClaimed += claimableAmount;
        emit Claimed(categoryId, vestingId, user, claimableAmount);
    }

    uint256 unvested = userVesting.amount - userVesting.claimed;

    delete userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user]; // Deletes the original data

    category.allocated -= unvested;

    emit CancelVesting(categoryId, vestingId, user, giveUnclaimed);
}
```

### **Impact**

- **State Inconsistency:** Modifications to `userVesting.claimed` and `userVesting.locked` are not saved, leading to incorrect tracking of claimed and locked amounts.
  
- **Potential Over-Allocation:** Users may end up with incorrect vesting balances, potentially allowing them to claim more tokens than intended.

- **Financial Loss:** The contract's inability to accurately track vesting amounts could lead to financial discrepancies, affecting both users and the overall token supply management.

### **Recommendation**

Change the declaration of `userVesting` from `memory` to `storage` to ensure that any updates to the `UserVesting` struct are persisted to the contract's state.

#### **Corrected Code:**

```solidity
function cancelVesting(uint256 categoryId, uint256 vestingId, address user, bool giveUnclaimed)
    external
    onlyOwner
{
    UserVesting storage userVesting = userVestings[categoryId][vestingId][user]; // Corrected to 'storage'

    // ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
}
```

### **Additional Notes**

- Similar issues might arise in other functions if `memory` is used instead of `storage` when modifying state variables. It's crucial to review all functions that interact with storage variables to ensure they use the correct storage location specifier.
  
- Consider adding unit tests that simulate the `cancelVesting` function to catch such issues during development.
