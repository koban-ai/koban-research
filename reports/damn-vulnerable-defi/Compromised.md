# Synthesized Solidity Smart Contract Security Audit Report

## Vulnerability 1: Lack of Input Validation in `_computeMedianPrice` Leading to Denial of Service

### Severity: High

### Description

In the `TrustfulOracle` contract, the `_computeMedianPrice` function does not validate if the `prices` array is non-empty before attempting to compute the median price. If the `prices` array is empty (which can occur if none of the trusted sources have set a price for a given symbol), the function will attempt to access elements at invalid indices, leading to an out-of-bounds array access and causing the transaction to revert.

```solidity
function _computeMedianPrice(string memory symbol) private view returns (uint256) {
  uint256[] memory prices = getAllPricesForSymbol(symbol);
  LibSort.insertionSort(prices);
  if (prices.length % 2 == 0) {
      uint256 leftPrice = prices[(prices.length / 2) - 1];
      uint256 rightPrice = prices[prices.length / 2];
      return (leftPrice + rightPrice) / 2; // Potential overflow and out-of-bounds access
  } else {
      return prices[prices.length / 2];
  }
}
```

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by ensuring that none of the trusted sources have set a price for a specific symbol. This would prevent the oracle from providing a price, leading to a denial of service for any contracts or users relying on the oracleâ€™s price feed for that symbol.

### Fix

- Add input validation to ensure that the `prices` array is not empty before attempting to compute the median.
- If the array is empty, the function should revert with a clear error message.

## Vulnerability 2: Possibility of Zero Price Allowing Free NFT Minting

### Severity: High

### Description

In the `Exchange` contract's `buyOne` function, there is a check to ensure that the payment is at least equal to the oracle's median price for the NFT. However, if the oracle's median price is manipulated to zero (e.g., due to trusted sources setting the price to zero or not setting a price at all), the function allows users to mint NFTs without effectively paying for them.

```solidity
function buyOne() external payable nonReentrant returns (uint256 id) {
  if (msg.value == 0) {
      revert InvalidPayment();
  }

  uint256 price = oracle.getMedianPrice(token.symbol());
  if (msg.value < price) {
      revert InvalidPayment();
  }

  id = token.safeMint(msg.sender);
  unchecked {
      payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - price); // Refunds full msg.value if price is zero
  }

  emit TokenBought(msg.sender, id, price);
}
```

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the oracle to report a zero price, allowing them to mint unlimited NFTs essentially for free. This undermines the economic integrity of the NFT system and could lead to significant financial losses.

### Fix

- Enforce a minimum acceptable price in the `buyOne` function to prevent purchases when the price is zero or unreasonably low.
- Add validation in the oracle to prevent trusted sources from setting a zero price or implement a minimum price threshold.

## Vulnerability 3: Potential Overflow in Median Price Calculation

### Severity: Medium

### Description

In the oracle's median price calculation, when the number of prices is even, the function sums the two middle prices to compute their average. If trusted sources set extremely high prices close to `uint256.max`, adding these two values can cause an arithmetic overflow, resulting in a transaction revert due to Solidity 0.8's overflow checks.

```solidity
if (prices.length % 2 == 0) {
  uint256 leftPrice = prices[(prices.length / 2) - 1];
  uint256 rightPrice = prices[prices.length / 2];
  return (leftPrice + rightPrice) / 2; // Potential overflow here
} else {
  return prices[prices.length / 2];
}
```

### Impact

An attacker controlling enough trusted sources could set exorbitantly high prices to deliberately cause an overflow, effectively making the oracle unusable for that symbol. This results in a denial of service for any dependent systems.

### Fix

- Use safe math operations or check for potential overflows before adding the two prices.
- Implement maximum price limits to prevent trusted sources from setting unreasonably high prices.
- Validate inputs from trusted sources to ensure they fall within acceptable ranges.

## Vulnerability 4: Oracle Centralization Due to Unrestricted `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`

### Severity: High

### Description

The `TrustfulOracle` contract uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlEnumerable` to manage roles for controlling who can post prices to the oracle. By default, `AccessControl` assigns the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the deployer of the contract (i.e., `msg.sender` during deployment). This role has the authority to grant and revoke any roles, including `TRUSTED_SOURCE_ROLE` and `INITIALIZER_ROLE`. 

In the provided implementation, the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is not renounced or transferred, meaning that the deployer retains this role indefinitely. As a result, the deployer (or anyone who compromises the deployer's private key) can at any time:

- Grant themselves (or any other address) the `TRUSTED_SOURCE_ROLE`.
- Post arbitrary prices to the oracle for any symbol.
- Manipulate the median price calculation.

This centralization poses a significant risk, as it allows the deployer to manipulate prices reported by the oracle, which can have severe consequences for contracts relying on this oracle for price feeds. In the context of the `Exchange` contract, this vulnerability could be exploited to manipulate NFT prices, allowing the deployer to:

- Set the price of the NFT to an extremely low value, purchase NFTs cheaply, and then set a high price to sell them back to the exchange, extracting the exchange's ether balance.
- Manipulate prices to cause financial loss to users interacting with the exchange.

### Exploit Scenario

1. **Initial Setup**: The `TrustfulOracle` is deployed by `deployer_address`, who retains the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
2. **Price Manipulation**:
   - `deployer_address` uses `grantRole` to assign themselves the `TRUSTED_SOURCE_ROLE`.
   - Posts a significantly low price for the NFT symbol (e.g., `0.1 wei`).
3. **Buying NFTs at Low Price**:
   - `deployer_address` calls `buyOne()` on the `Exchange`, purchasing NFTs at the manipulated low price.
4. **Price Increase Manipulation**:
   - `deployer_address` posts a significantly high price for the NFT symbol (e.g., `1000 ether`).
5. **Selling NFTs at High Price**:
   - `deployer_address` approves the `Exchange` to transfer their NFTs.
   - Calls `sellOne()` on the `Exchange`, selling the NFTs back at the inflated price, draining the exchange's ether balance.

### Fix

- **Renounce `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`**: After initialization, the deployer should renounce the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to prevent any further role assignments.
```solidity
function renounceAdminRole() external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    renounceRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
}
```
- **Multi-Signature Governance**: If role management is necessary, consider using a multi-signature wallet or a DAO mechanism to distribute control and prevent a single point of failure.
- **Immutable Role Assignments**: Assign roles to trusted addresses during deployment and make role assignments immutable by not exposing `grantRole` or `revokeRole` functions publicly.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Implement off-chain monitoring to detect any unauthorized role changes or price manipulations, and promptly respond to any suspicious activities.

## Summary

The provided contracts have several vulnerabilities related to inadequate input validation, potential arithmetic overflows, and centralization risks in the oracle. These issues can be exploited to cause denial of service, manipulate NFT pricing, and undermine the system's integrity. It is essential to implement proper checks and validations to ensure that the oracle and exchange functions operate securely and reliably.
