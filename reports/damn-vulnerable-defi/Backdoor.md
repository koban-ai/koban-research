# Synthesized Security Audit Report

## 1. Inadequate Validation of Safe Wallet Setup Allows Unauthorized Access to Tokens

### Description

The `WalletRegistry` contract is designed to reward legitimate beneficiaries with tokens when they create and register a Safe wallet. However, it **fails to validate whether any modules are enabled** on the newly created Safe wallet. 

This oversight allows an attacker to create a Safe wallet with the owner set as a legitimate beneficiary but with a malicious module enabled, granting the attacker control over the wallet's funds. As a result, the attacker can receive the token payment intended for the beneficiary and withdraw the tokens for themselves.

### Severity

**High** - This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass security checks and steal tokens.

### Fix

To mitigate this issue, the `WalletRegistry` contract should include a validation step to ensure that no modules are enabled in the newly created Safe wallet.

#### Suggested Code Change

```solidity
function proxyCreated(
  SafeProxy proxy,
  address singleton,
  bytes calldata initializer,
  uint256
) external override {
  // Existing checks...

  // Check that no modules are enabled
  address[] memory modules = Safe(walletAddress).getModules();
  if (modules.length != 0) {
      revert ModulesAreEnabled();
  }

  // Proceed with wallet registration and token transfer
}

error ModulesAreEnabled();
```

Alternatively, directly check the storage slot for modules to ensure it's empty:

```solidity
function _getModules(address payable wallet) private view returns (address[] memory) {
  bytes memory encodedModules = Safe(wallet).getStorageAt(MODULE_STORAGE_SLOT, modulesDataLength);
  return abi.decode(encodedModules, (address[]));
}
```

## 2. Incorrect Storage Slot Calculation Allows Setting Non-Zero Fallback Manager

### Description

The `WalletRegistry` contract incorrectly computes the storage slot for the `fallbackManager` in the `Safe` contract. This flaw allows an attacker to set a non-zero fallback manager in the Safe wallet without detection. 

The fallback manager can be an attacker-controlled contract, allowing them to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Safe wallet. Once the wallet receives the token payment, the attacker can use the fallback manager to transfer these tokens to themselves.

### Severity

**High** - This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass critical security checks, leading to unauthorized code execution and potential theft of tokens.

### Fix

To fix this vulnerability, the `WalletRegistry` should correctly determine the storage slot of the `fallbackManager` in the `Safe` contract.

#### Suggested Code Change

Use the correct storage slot:

```solidity
bytes32 internal constant FALLBACK_HANDLER_STORAGE_SLOT = bytes32(uint256(keccak256("fallback_handler.address")) - 1);
```

Update the `_getFallbackManager` function accordingly:

```solidity
function _getFallbackManager(address payable wallet) private view returns (address) {
    return abi.decode(
        Safe(wallet).getStorageAt(uint256(FALLBACK_HANDLER_STORAGE_SLOT), 0x20), (address)
    );
}
```

Alternatively, directly call a public getter function from the `Safe` contract:

```solidity
function _getFallbackManager(address wallet) private view returns (address) {
  return Safe(wallet).getFallbackHandler();
}
```

If the `Safe` contract does not provide a public getter, add one:

```solidity
function getFallbackHandler() public view returns (address) {
  return fallbackManager;
}
```

By correctly retrieving the fallback manager, the registry can accurately enforce that no fallback manager is set in the newly created Safe wallet, ensuring the integrity of the security checks.

---

## Conclusion

The identified vulnerabilities in the `WalletRegistry` contract allow attackers to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access to tokens. The two primary issues are:

1. **Lack of validation for enabled modules**, allowing attackers to install malicious modules that can execute arbitrary transactions.
2. **Incorrect storage slot calculation for the fallback manager**, enabling attackers to set a non-zero fallback manager without detection.

By implementing the recommended fixes, the contract can ensure that only properly configured Safe wallets are registered, preventing unauthorized access and token theft.
