# **Security Audit Report for FreeRiderNFTMarketplace**

## **1. Incorrect Payment to Seller in `_buyOne` Function**

### **Severity:** High

### **Description:**
The `_buyOne` function in the `FreeRiderNFTMarketplace` contract contains a critical vulnerability where the payment intended for the seller is mistakenly sent to the buyer instead. This occurs because the contract retrieves the owner of the NFT **after** transferring it to the buyer, causing the payment to be sent to the buyer instead of the seller.

### **Impact:**
- **Financial Loss for Sellers:** Sellers do not receive payment for their NFTs.
- **Unfair Gain for Buyers:** Buyers can acquire NFTs without actually spending Ether.
- **Market Disruption:** Undermines trust in the marketplace and could lead to significant losses.

### **Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
function _buyOne(uint256 tokenId) private {
  uint256 priceToPay = offers[tokenId];
  if (priceToPay == 0) {
      revert TokenNotOffered(tokenId);
  }

  if (msg.value < priceToPay) {
      revert InsufficientPayment();
  }

  --offersCount;

  // Transfer from seller to buyer
  DamnValuableNFT _token = token; // cache for gas savings
  _token.safeTransferFrom(_token.ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender, tokenId);

  // Incorrect owner retrieved after transfer
  payable(_token.ownerOf(tokenId)).sendValue(priceToPay);

  emit NFTBought(msg.sender, tokenId, priceToPay);
}
```

### **Fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, the seller's address should be determined **before** the NFT is transferred.

```solidity
function _buyOne(uint256 tokenId) private {
  uint256 priceToPay = offers[tokenId];
  if (priceToPay == 0) {
      revert TokenNotOffered(tokenId);
  }

  if (msg.value < priceToPay) {
      revert InsufficientPayment();
  }

  --offersCount;

  DamnValuableNFT _token = token; // cache for gas savings

  // Retrieve the seller's address before the transfer
  address seller = _token.ownerOf(tokenId);

  // Transfer from seller to buyer
  _token.safeTransferFrom(seller, msg.sender, tokenId);

  // Pay the seller
  payable(seller).sendValue(priceToPay);

  emit NFTBought(msg.sender, tokenId, priceToPay);
}
```

## **2. Incorrect Manipulation of `offersCount` Leading to Denial of Service**

### **Severity:** High

### **Description:**
The `offersCount` state variable is incorrectly incremented due to an erroneous storage slot reference in inline assembly. This causes `offersCount` to remain at zero. When a buyer attempts to purchase an NFT, the contract decrements `offersCount` using `--offersCount;`. Since `offersCount` is zero, this operation underflows, causing a revert due to Solidity 0.8's checked arithmetic. As a result, **no NFTs can be purchased from the marketplace**, leading to a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.

### **Impact:**
- **Denial of Service:** Users are unable to purchase any NFTs.
- **Business Logic Failure:** The core functionality of buying NFTs is disrupted.
- **Financial Loss:** Sellers cannot sell their NFTs.
- **User Trust:** The platform's reliability is compromised.

### **Vulnerable Code:**
#### **Incorrect Increment in `_offerOne` Function**
```solidity
function _offerOne(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price) private {
  assembly {
      // Incorrectly increments storage slot 0x02 instead of offersCount at slot 0x01
      sstore(0x02, add(sload(0x02), 0x01))
  }
}
```

#### **Decrement Leading to Underflow in `_buyOne` Function**
```solidity
function _buyOne(uint256 tokenId) private {
  --offersCount; // Underflows if offersCount is zero
}
```

### **Fix:**
1. **Correct the Storage Slot in Assembly:**
```solidity
assembly {
    // Correct storage slot for offersCount is 0x01
    sstore(0x01, add(sload(0x01), 0x01))
}
```
2. **Avoid Using Inline Assembly:**
```solidity
++offersCount;
```

## **3. Use of `tx.origin` for Authorization in `FreeRiderRecoveryManager`**

### **Severity:** Medium

### **Description:**
The `FreeRiderRecoveryManager` contract uses `tx.origin` for validating the beneficiary in the `onERC721Received` function. Using `tx.origin` for authorization is considered an anti-pattern and can lead to unauthorized access through smart contract composability or phishing attacks.

### **Vulnerable Code:**
```solidity
if (tx.origin != beneficiary) {
  revert OriginNotBeneficiary();
}
```

### **Impact:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may bypass beneficiary checks.
- **Security Risks Through Phishing:** Beneficiaries could be tricked into interacting with malicious contracts.

### **Fix:**
Use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin`:
```solidity
if (msg.sender != beneficiary) {
  revert SenderNotBeneficiary();
}
```

---

## **Conclusion**
The identified vulnerabilities pose significant risks to the security and functionality of the `FreeRiderNFTMarketplace` contract. Immediate fixes should be implemented to prevent financial losses, denial of service, and unauthorized access. Additionally, thorough testing and security audits should be conducted before deployment.
