# Synthesized Security Audit Report

## 1. Unauthorized Token Withdrawal via L1Forwarder Message Replay

### Description

An attacker can exploit the interaction between `L1Forwarder` and `TokenBridge` contracts to perform unauthorized token withdrawals. By manipulating the `failedMessages` state in `L1Forwarder`, an attacker can repeatedly call `forwardMessage` with arbitrary parameters, setting the `l2Sender` context to an address of their choice. This allows the attacker to bypass the access control checks in `TokenBridge`'s `executeTokenWithdrawal` function, resulting in the unauthorized transfer of tokens.

### Severity

**High**

### Impact

- An attacker can withdraw arbitrary amounts of tokens from the `TokenBridge`, leading to a significant loss of funds.
- The security model of the bridge is compromised, allowing unauthorized withdrawals.

### Root Cause

- **Weak Replay Protection:** The `L1Forwarder` allows replays of failed messages without proper validation, enabling attackers to replay messages for unauthorized actions.
- **Improper Authentication:** The `TokenBridge` relies on `l1Forwarder.getSender()` for authentication, which can be manipulated by the attacker during the replayed `forwardMessage` call.

### Exploit Scenario

1. **Trigger a Failed Message in `L1Forwarder`**
   - The attacker calls `L1Forwarder.forwardMessage` with parameters that cause the internal call to fail (e.g., invalid `target` or malformed `message` data).
   - This results in `failedMessages[messageId] = true`.

2. **Replay the Message to Perform Unauthorized Withdrawal**
   - The attacker calls `L1Forwarder.forwardMessage` again with the same `messageId`.
   - Sets `l2Sender` to an address they control (ensuring it is not `otherBridge`).
   - Sets `target` as the `TokenBridge` contract.
   - Crafts a `message` to call `executeTokenWithdrawal`, specifying the attacker's address and desired amount.
   - Since `failedMessages[messageId] = true`, the call proceeds.
   - The `TokenBridge.executeTokenWithdrawal` function executes, transferring tokens to the attacker's address.

### Fix

1. **Strengthen Replay Protections in `L1Forwarder`**
   - Prevent external parties from calling `forwardMessage` directly unless they provide cryptographic proofs.
   - Implement nonce management or timestamps to prevent replay attacks.

2. **Enhance Authentication in `TokenBridge`**
   - Implement stricter checks, possibly involving cryptographic signatures or non-replayable messages.
   - Ensure that `l1Forwarder.getSender()` is verified against a trusted list of addresses.

3. **Validate Message Integrity**
   - Ensure that messages processed by `L1Forwarder` and `TokenBridge` are valid and have not been tampered with or replayed.
   - Introduce Merkle proofs or other cryptographic verification mechanisms.

4. **Restrict Replayed Messages**
   - Modify the logic in `forwardMessage` to prevent unauthorized replays.
   - Instead of allowing anyone to retry failed messages, restrict retries to trusted entities or implement a timeout mechanism.

## Conclusion

The interaction between `L1Forwarder` and `TokenBridge` allows an attacker to exploit the system and perform unauthorized withdrawals. By carefully crafting messages and leveraging the lack of stringent checks, the attacker can manipulate the contracts to transfer tokens without proper authorization. Immediate action is recommended to patch this vulnerability and protect the assets within the bridge.
