# Synthesized Security Audit Report

## Vulnerability: Oracle Manipulation Allows Under-Collateralized Borrowing

### Severity: High

### Description

The `PuppetV2Pool` contract allows users to borrow tokens by depositing WETH as collateral, with the required deposit calculated based on the token's price relative to WETH. This price is fetched directly from Uniswap V2 reserves via the `_getOracleQuote` function. However, this reliance on Uniswap V2's spot price introduces a critical vulnerability:

- **Manipulable Price Oracle**: Uniswap V2 prices can be easily manipulated within a single transaction, especially in pools with low liquidity. An attacker can exploit this by drastically altering the token's price relative to WETH within the Uniswap V2 pair.

### Attack Scenario

1. **Manipulate Uniswap V2 Price**:
   - The attacker swaps a large amount of WETH for the target token (or vice versa) on Uniswap V2, significantly changing the reserves and thus manipulating the reported price.
   - This can be done within a single transaction using a flash loan, allowing the attacker to borrow tokens without initial capital.

2. **Under-Collateralized Borrowing**:
   - With the manipulated price, the `_getOracleQuote` function calculates a much lower value for the required WETH deposit.
   - The attacker calls the `borrow` function to borrow a large amount of tokens, depositing only a minimal amount of WETH as collateral.

3. **Revert Price Manipulation**:
   - The attacker reverses the initial trade on Uniswap V2, restoring the reserves to their original state and profiting from the difference.

4. **Profit Extraction**:
   - The attacker now holds the borrowed tokens obtained with insufficient collateral, leading to potential loss for the protocol.

### Impact

- **Financial Loss**: The protocol loses funds as attackers can drain the token reserves without providing adequate WETH collateral.
- **Collateral Undermined**: The security model relying on the WETH deposit being worth three times the borrowed amount is broken.
- **Trust Erosion**: Users may lose trust in the protocol's security, affecting its reputation and usage.

### Affected Code

```solidity
function calculateDepositOfWETHRequired(uint256 tokenAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 depositFactor = 3;
    return _getOracleQuote(tokenAmount) * depositFactor / 1 ether;
}

function _getOracleQuote(uint256 amount) private view returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 reservesWETH, uint256 reservesToken) =
        UniswapV2Library.getReserves({factory: _uniswapFactory, tokenA: address(_weth), tokenB: address(_token)});

    return UniswapV2Library.quote({amountA: amount * 10 ** 18, reserveA: reservesToken, reserveB: reservesWETH});
}
```

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Use Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)**:
   - Implement a TWAP oracle that averages the price over a longer period, making manipulation significantly more expensive and difficult.
   - Uniswap V2 provides a TWAP mechanism that can be integrated to resist flash loan attacks.

2. **Oracle Diversification**:
   - Incorporate prices from multiple reputable sources, such as Chainlink or other decentralized oracles, to reduce dependency on a single manipulable source.

3. **Liquidity Thresholds**:
   - Enforce a minimum liquidity requirement for the Uniswap V2 pair to be considered valid for price feeds.

4. **Price Slippage Checks**:
   - Implement checks that detect and prevent borrowing if the price deviates significantly from expected market values.

5. **Require Multiple Transactions**:
   - Design the borrowing process to occur over multiple blocks, making flash loan attacks more difficult.
   - Require users to lock collateral for a certain period before borrowing.

### Conclusion

The `PuppetV2Pool` contract is critically vulnerable due to its reliance on the manipulable price from Uniswap V2. Without safeguards against price manipulation, attackers can exploit this to borrow tokens with insufficient collateral, leading to substantial losses for the protocol. Implementing a TWAP oracle and additional safeguards can mitigate this vulnerability.
